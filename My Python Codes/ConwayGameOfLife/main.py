In loving memory of John Horton Conway.

The following is a class that simulates a zero-player game session of Conway's Game Of Life.
It recieves the size of the board, the starting mode and rules.
Moreover if an RLE is present, it will ignore the starting mode and translate the RLE code into the matrix of choice.

It must be noted that the board game is a periodical space, so an input of an RLE close to the borders will loop around the board.
